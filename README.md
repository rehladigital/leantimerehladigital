## Runtime status

- **Production runtime:** PHP app from repository root (this is the complete app with full theme and modules).
- **Node migration track:** preserved under `node-migration/` for future modernization work; it is not the active production path.
- **Release target:** `1.0.0` tag on `main`.

## System requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL/MariaDB or SQLite
- Apache/Nginx/IIS (with required routing support)
- Standard PHP extensions required by this project

## Local setup (quick start)

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure `config/.env` with required values
3. Point web root to `public/`
4. Open `/install` and complete setup

## Hostinger shared hosting (validated)

Great news: this app is confirmed to run on Hostinger shared hosting (no root access) with full UI assets and OIDC flow.

### Exact deployment steps

1. Create a subdomain/domain in Hostinger (example: `pm.example.com`).
2. Upload the repository to:
   - `/home/<user>/domains/<domain>/public_html/<app-folder>`
3. In Hostinger PHP settings, use PHP `8.2+` (recommended `8.3`).
4. Create `config/.env` (or `<app-folder>/.env`) with your DB + app settings:
   - `LEAN_APP_URL='https://<your-domain>'`
   - `LEAN_DB_DEFAULT_CONNECTION='mysql'`
   - `LEAN_DB_HOST`, `LEAN_DB_DATABASE`, `LEAN_DB_USER`, `LEAN_DB_PASSWORD`, `LEAN_DB_PORT`
   - `LEAN_SESSION_PASSWORD='<random-strong-value>'`
   - OIDC values if SSO is required (`LEAN_OIDC_ENABLE`, `LEAN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `LEAN_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LEAN_OIDC_PROVIDER_URL`)
5. Ensure root rewrite forwards requests to `public/`:
   - file: `<app-folder>/.htaccess`
6. Ensure front controller rewrite is present:
   - file: `<app-folder>/public/.htaccess`
7. Install production dependencies:
   - `php composer.phar install --no-dev --prefer-dist -o --ignore-platform-reqs`
8. Clear runtime caches:
   - `/opt/alt/php83/usr/bin/php bin/leantime cache:clearAll`
9. Confirm static assets are present and directly accessible:
   - `<app-folder>/public/dist/**`
   - `<app-folder>/public/theme/**`
   - URLs like `https://<your-domain>/dist/css/main.3.7.1.min.css` must return `200`
10. Open `https://<your-domain>/auth/login` and complete login/install verification.

### Post-deploy verification checklist

- `GET /auth/login` returns `200`
- `GET /dist/css/main.3.7.1.min.css` returns `200`
- `GET /dist/js/compiled-frameworks.3.7.1.min.js` returns `200`
- OIDC start endpoint redirects to your provider
- Successful login reaches `/dashboard/home`

### One-command verification script

- Run all checks:
  - `SITE_URL=https://<your-domain> bash scripts/deploy-checklist.sh`
- Include authenticated dashboard validation:
  - `LOGIN_USERNAME=<email> LOGIN_PASSWORD=<password> SITE_URL=https://<your-domain> bash scripts/deploy-checklist.sh`

### In-app version updater (owner only)

- Location: `Administration -> Company Settings -> Version Updater`
- Purpose: update app files with either:
  - Git tag update (if git exists on server), or
  - Manual ZIP package upload (works on Hostinger shared hosting without git).
- ZIP update flow:
  - download release ZIP from repository
  - upload ZIP in `Version Updater`
  - system updates files while preserving runtime paths
  - runs `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist -o --ignore-platform-reqs`
  - runs `php bin/leantime cache:clearAll`
- Safety guarantees:
  - does **not** modify `config/.env`
  - does **not** reset DB/install state
  - does **not** delete `storage/` or `userfiles/`
  - does **not** overwrite user settings records in DB
- Update notification:
  - `Version Updater` shows latest release and flags when a newer version is available.

### Recommended FTP update command (safe sync)

Use this script for future deployments to avoid overwriting runtime data:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/ftp-safe-sync.ps1 `
  -Host "185.162.54.190" `
  -Port 65002 `
  -User "<hostinger-user>" `
  -Password "<hostinger-password>" `
  -RemotePath "/home/<user>/domains/<domain>/public_html/pm" `
  -SourcePath "."
```

This sync excludes `config/.env`, `storage/`, `userfiles/`, local logs, databases, and developer-only folders.

## Setup helper files

- `composer.phar`: local Composer binary included for environments without a global Composer install.
- `manual_sqlite_install.php`: helper script to bootstrap SQLite install data.

Use environment variables with `manual_sqlite_install.php`:

`ALMUDHEER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ALMUDHEER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ALMUDHEER_ADMIN_FIRSTNAME`, `ALMUDHEER_ADMIN_LASTNAME`, `ALMUDHEER_COMPANY_NAME`, `ALMUDHEER_COMPANY_COUNTRY`, `ALMUDHEER_CURRENCY_CODE`, `ALMUDHEER_TIMEZONE`

Default helper-script login (if env vars are not set):
- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Change this immediately in any non-local/shared environment.

## Development

- Run frontend/build tools as configured in this repository
- Use the local PHP server for quick testing:

```bash
php -S localhost:8090 -t public
```

## Notes

- App title and branding are set to **Al Mudheer**
- Login flow is configured to prioritize SSO
- Most runtime settings are managed in the database
- Timesheets and work tracking are planned for a future release
